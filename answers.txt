Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We use git because it allows developers to track changes effectively. It also allows for
multiple people to collaborate on the same project and stitch together their code. This ultimately allows
teams of coders to work together on very large projects which would be impractical for lone coders to develop.
