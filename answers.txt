Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We use git because it allows developers to track changes effectively. It also allows for
multiple people to collaborate on the same project and stitch together their code. This ultimately allows
teams of coders to work together on very large projects which would be impractical for lone coders to develop.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to the medical field to better analyze patient outcomes and responses to new
treatments. Knowing how patients react to treatments and collecting data related to trials will allow researchers to
determine the effectiveness and viability of new developing treatments.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Merging takes the new commits in the original branch which were made after the new branch was created,
and makes a commit onto the new branch with those changes, incorporating the changes. Merge conflicts will need
to be resolved.

Rebasing takes the new branch and adds it onto the end of the original branch, resulting in only one branch that
contains the commits of both the original and new branches. This creates a linear history, as opposed to merging,
which still results in two seperate commit histories.
